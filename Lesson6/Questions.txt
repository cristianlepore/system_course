- What is a pointer?
- How do I declare a pointer of type integer?
    int *p;
    p is a pointer variable capable of pointing to object of type int
- Can I declare a pointer along with the declaration of other variables?
    yes
    ex:
        int i, j, a[10], *p, *q;
- double *p --> point only to object of type double
- Which operator are specifically used with pointers?
    & and *
- What is the indirection operator? *
    Once the pointer points to an object, we can use * operator to access what is stored in the object.
- What is the meaning of this statement? j = *&i;
    & produces a pointer while applying * to the pointer takes us back to the original variable.
    j = *&i; --> same as j = i;
- Do we need to always initialize a pointer?
    yes, otherwise we get an error.
- Can we assign a pointer to another pointer?
    yes, but there is a constraint
    the two pointers must be of the same type
- If I have two pointers *p, *q What is the difference between p = q and *p = *q
- How can I pass an agument that must not be modify to a function?
    using const
