- How the printf function is constructed? Can you give me an example?
- Meaning of this letter % in %d --> conversion specifications
- What does this string mean? printf("%d, %f \n", i, j);
- What happen if you have one placeholder and two variable? printf("%d", i, j);
- Which compiler is more permissive? Java or C? Why?
- What is the result of this instruction?
    char i, x;
    printf("%f %d\n", i, x);

- What is the general format of conversion specifications?
- conversion specification: %8.2f or %.4f ??
    example 
    n=1.9890778;
    then printf("%6.2f",n); will print 1.98
    n=7687.87686;
    then it will print 7687.87

- What happen if I do: printf("%10d", 112); ??? How will be the output formatted?
- What are the conversion specification that you know?
    f --> fixed decimal, indicates how many digits will appear after the decimal point --> by default are 6 digits
    e --> exponential
    g --> either exponential format or decimal format
- What is the difference between
    int x = 20;
    printf("%d %7d %-7d", x, x, x);
- What is the meaning of this:
    printf("%10.3f | %10.3e", num, num);
- Escape sequence:
    \a --> alert bell
    \b --> backspace
    \n --> new line
    \t --> tabulation
- Escape sequence printf("\"Hello World\"") What does this print?

- Scanf --> explain the Scanf function
- Can I have many white spaces when I type the variable in scanf? Can I have tabulation or vertical spaces? --> Yes
- How this string will be read?
    1-20.3-4.0e3¤ 
    scanf("%d%d%f%f", &i, &j, &x, &y);
    Result:
        > %d. Stores 1 into i and puts the - character back. 
        > %d. Stores –20 into j and puts the . character back. 
        > %f. Stores 0.3 into x and puts the - character back.  
        > %f. Stores –4.0 × 10^3 into y and puts the new-line character back.
- What is the difference between:
    > scanf("%d/%d", &x, &i); /* if I type: •5•/•96 or •5/•96
    > which one is correct?
- How do you interpret this?
    scanf("%d, %d", &x, &i);  /* There is a comma between the two %d */
- Show me the exercise addFrac.c that we did in the lecture.
- There is a typo in the program. Can you find where?
- How would you fix the mistake
