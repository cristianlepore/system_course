Welcome everbody, welcome to this fifth session of the practicals.

******************************

As usual, the plan for today consists on a 15 minutes presentation, then about 10 minutes for questions and answers and 35 minutes for checkpoints.

******************************

A brief summary from the previous weeks.
 
Week 2, we saw the basic of C programming language.

In week 3, we studied further input output functions such as putchar and getchar, and the arrays.

Finally, the last week we saw typedef and structures.

Are there any questions about these previous arguments?

...

For today I would like to review together with you the functions. Just one topic, but it is pretty big though.

******************************

In particular, we are going to discuss about these four things:
- how to define a function
- how to declare a function
- calling a function
- and passing arguments to a function

This is of course not exhaustive, but you find a complete reviews of functions in your last lecture online.

******************************

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. 

Every program has at least one function, which is indeed the main() function, and we can also define further functions.

for example, we can divide up our code into separate pieces. The way we divide our code represents a logical split of our program into sub-routine where each function performs a particular task.

The C standard provides several built-in functions that you can call. For example, printf() is a built-in function which has been declared into the standard library, so we do not need to add its declaration.

But if the function is not part of the standard library, we need to declare it. For example, here I have declared two functions that compute the maximum and the average between two values.

We will go more in details in a moment.

******************************

How we can define a function?

well, this is a way.

Each function has a header and a body. Line 2 represents the header, the remaining part is the body.

The header contains the return type, the function name and the parameters.

returning type - A function may return an integer, a double, a float. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning any value. In this case, the return type is the keyword void.

Function Name − is the actual name of the function. Ususally we use lowercase letters and underscore to separate words

Parameters − A parameter is like a placeholder and actually, it is optional. We can have functions without any parameter.

Function Body − The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.

Here, I have a function called my_function that takes one parameter and returns an integer value.

******************************

Position of a function in our code.

We can define a function almost everywhere.

I can declare a function before the main like in this case. We have two functions, max and avarage both declared before the main.

That is ok, because the compiler goes down step by step starting from line 1, it executes the main and if the compiler gets a function call (into the main), the compiler will jump to execute that function. So, it will go back executing the max or average.

But what happen if we do not define the function before the main?

******************************

well, here's an example. You can see that I have moved the two functions after main.
This raises an error on the right hand side.

Why?
Because in the right side, the compiler has no clue about whether the function has been declared.
As I said, the compiler goes down step by step, enters the main function and if it finds a function call, the compiler will start looking for this function into the system library rather than other functions. 

without getting any result, this will raise an error.

******************************

To avoid such a behaviour, we need to add the function declaration before main, as I did here in line 1 and 2.

This two lines suggest to the compiler that max and average have been defined somewhere into our program.

So the question now is how do we declare these functions? What is their structure...

******************************

Declaring a function

A function declaration contains a name, return type, and parameters.

Actually, the name of parameters are not so important but only their type is required, so the second case (showed below) is also a valid declaration. So I have dropped out parameter1 and parameter2 from the declaration.

so as simple as int my_function(int, int);

******************************

Calling a function

to describe how to call a function is better to see an example of a complete program. This program computes the maximum between two values using a function.

from top to bottom, we see the function declaration.

The main function and in line 18 the function definition.

How do we call this function?
Inside the main, we need to pass the required parameters along with the function name, and if the function returns a value, then we can store the returned value.

be careful, because the function should return the same type of the variable that has been declare.

We can go in more details: when a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function, in our case the control is shifted to the max function. The max function performs the task and when its return statement is executed, the function returns the program control back to the main program.

******************************

Here's an example of how to pass arguments to a function.

I have declared two variables A and B in line 9 and 10, having value 100 and 200. Then we can simply pass these values to a function as I did in line 13.

There are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function. Called by value and called by reference.

By default, C uses call by value to pass arguments. 
What does it mean?
Called by value means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.

Translated --> variables num1 and num2 have a scope which is inside the function sum.
while variables a, b, and result have a scope inside the main function.

When I pass an argument by value, what I am doing in memory is to copy the value of a and b into a new memory location num1 and num2 which will be overwritten as soon as the function ends.

******************************

When we work with arrays though, we will pass it as a reference.
That means, we do not copy the array into a new memory location, instead we only pass a reference to the array. A reference is a pointer to the array.

Hence, every time we modify the array into the function, we overwrite the actual elements of the array that the main function is referring to.

******************************

Next lesson I am going to give you an overview of pointers.
