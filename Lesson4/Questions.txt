- explain what putchar is
- can putchar write more than character or just a single char? 
    one character passed as pointer.
- explain the function getchar
- does getchar return an integer or a string/char? 
    It returns an integer
- what is the disadvantage of getchar? 
    The input keeps buffering till enter is pressed.
- can getchar read more than one character at a time? 
    No, it can't
- tell me difference between scanf and getchar
- What is a potential problem in this example??
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &i);
    printf("Enter a command: ");
    command = getchar();

    N.B. --> The scanf leave behind any characters that weren't consumed during the reading of i. Hence, getchar will fetch the first leftover character.

- Does C has boolean type?
- How can I declare a boolean in C?
- How many ways do you know to define a bool? 
    #define and typedef
- What is an advantage of defining a typedef? 
    You can easily redefine the type by simply changing the fist line.
- Using typedef is also good for portability.
    e.g. int or char can be defined differently in several machines. Transporting the program to a machine with shorter integers, we will change the type definition. changing the definition may affect the way variables are used.
- The same problem as above does not apply to Java. Why?
    Because the types are implemented into the JVM and it is the same in all architectures.
- sizeof function? It returns an unsigned integer representing the number of bytes required to store a value belonging to type-name
    sizeof(char)  or   sizeof(int)
- sizeof can also be applied to constants, variables, and expressions in general.
    sizeof(i+j)

******************************
Arrays
- How do we initialize an array?
    int a[5] = {10, 3, 32, 7, 23};
    int a[9] = {0}; /* Initialize to all zeroes. */
- What does this mean?
    int a[15] = {[2] = 29, [9] = 7, [14] = 48};
- how do we call this [2] ??? --> designator
- How can we design a program to write the repeated digit?
- meaning of sizeof();
- What is the meaning of this instruction?
    sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]) --> returns the length of an array
        where a is an Arrays
- sizeof returns a value that is size_t which is defined in a suitable header file --> size_t is an unsigned integer
- How can I define a multidimensional array?
    int m[5][9];
- how can I access to the element in position j, i?
    m[j][i]
- how can I select an entire row?
    m[j] --> select row J
- I can declare an identity matrix like:
    double ident[2][2] = {[0][0] = 1.0, [1][1] = 1.0};
- How does the keywork const mean?
- How can I generate a random number?
- What is the meaning of srand?
- What's the meaning of the time function?
- What's the meaning of this instruction? srand(time(NULL));
